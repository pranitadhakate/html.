    <p><strong>Quantum mechanics</strong>is a fundamental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory">theory</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics">physics</a> that provides a description of the physical properties of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature">nature</a> at the scale of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom">atoms</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle">subatomic particles.</a><sup>[2]:1.1</sup>It is the foundation of all quantum physics including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_technology">quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology,</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information_science">quantum information science.</a>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics">Classical physics, </a>the collection of theories that existed before the advent of quantum mechanics, describes many aspects of nature at an ordinary (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale">macroscopic</a>) scale, but is not sufficient for describing them at small (atomic and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle"> subatomic </a>)scales. Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-3"> [3]</a></sup></p>
    
    <p>Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum">energy, momentum, angular momentum,</a> and other quantities of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state">bound</a> system are restricted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(physics)">discrete values (quantization</a>); objects have characteristics of both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle">particles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave">waves</a> (wave particle duality); and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).</p>


    Quantum mechanics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics">arose gradually</a> from theories to explain observations that could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck">Max Planck</a>'s solution in 1900 to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation">black-body radiation </a> problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein's 1905 paper,</a> which explained the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">photoelectric effect.</a> These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_quantum_theory">old quantum theory</a>", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac">Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Paul Dirac</a> , and others. The modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalisms. In one of them, a mathematical entity called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function">wave function</a> provides information, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude">probability amplitudes,</a> about what measurements of a particle's energy, momentum, and other physical properties may yield.

    <h2>Overview and fundamental concepts</h2>
    <img src="/home/b40/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2023-09-21 23-53-57.png" width="=350" height="450">

    <hr>
    <p>Quantum mechanics allows the calculation of properties and behaviour of physical systems. It is typically applied to microscopic systems: molecules, atoms and sub-atomic particles. It has been demonstrated to hold for complex molecules with thousands of atoms, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> but its application to human beings raises philosophical problems, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_friend">Wigner's friend</a>, and its application to the universe as a whole remains speculative. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy">accuracy</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-6"><sup>[note 1]</sup></a>




     <p>A fundamental feature of the theory is that it usually cannot predict with certainty what will happen, but only give probabilities. Mathematically, a probability is found by taking the square of the absolute value of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">complex number</a>, known as a probability amplitude. This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule">Born rule</a>, named after physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born">Max Born</a>. For example, a quantum particle like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron">electron</a> can be described by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function">wave function</a>, which associates to each point in space a probability amplitude. Applying the Born rule to these amplitudes gives a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density function</a> for the position that the electron will be found to have when an experiment is performed to measure it. This is the best the theory can do; it cannot say for certain where the electron will be found. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Schrödinger equation</a>  relates the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to one moment of time to the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to another.</p>

     <p>One consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is a tradeoff in predictability between different measurable quantities. The most famous form of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">uncertainty principle</a>  says that no matter how a quantum particle is prepared or how carefully experiments upon it are arranged, it is impossible to have a precise prediction for a measurement of its position and also at the same time for a measurement of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum">momentum</a></p>
    <p>Another consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is the phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_interference">aquantum interference</a> , which is often illustrated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment">double-slit experiment</a>. In the basic version of this experiment, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)">coherent light source</a>, such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser">laser</a> beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Lederman-7"><sup>[6]</sup></a>:102–111 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Feynman-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>:1.1–1.8 The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)">interfere</a>, producing bright and dark bands on the screen – a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Lederman-7"><sup>[6]</sup></a> However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles rather than waves; the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen. Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon">photon</a> passes through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Lederman-7"><sup>[6]</sup></a>: 109 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-M%C3%BCller-Kirsten-8 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Plotnitsky-9"><sup>[7][8]</sup></a> However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#Which_way">such experiments</a>  demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through. Other atomic-scale entities, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons">electrons</a>, are found to exhibit the same behavior when fired towards a double slit. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Feynman-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> This behavior is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality">wave–particle duality</a>.</p>

    <p>Another counter-intuitive phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling">quantum tunnelling</a> : a particle that goes up against a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_barrier">potential barrier</a>  can cross it, even if its kinetic energy is smaller than the maximum of the potential. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-10"><sup>[9]</sup></a> In classical mechanics this particle would be trapped. Quantum tunnelling has several important consequences, enabling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion">radioactive decay,nuclear fusion</a>, in stars, and applications such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunnelling_microscopy">scanning tunnelling microscopy</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_diode.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Trixler2013-11">tunnel diode . <sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

    <p>When quantum systems interact, the result can be the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">quantum entanglement</a> : their properties become so intertwined that a description of the whole solely in terms of the individual parts is no longer possible. Erwin Schrödinger called entanglement "...the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-12"><sup></sup>[11]</a> Quantum entanglement enables the counter-intuitive properties of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy">quantum pseudo-telepathy</a>, and can be a valuable resource in communication protocols, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution">quantum key distribution </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Caves-13">superdense coding. <sup>[12]</sup></a> Contrary to popular misconception, entanglement does not allow sending signals <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light">faster than light</a>, as demonstrated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Caves-13"> no-communication theorem. <sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

    <p>Another possibility opened by entanglement is testing for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory"> hidden variables</a>",hypothetical properties more fundamental than the quantities addressed in quantum theory itself, knowledge of which would allow more exact predictions than quantum theory can provide. A collection of results, most significantly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem">Bell's theorem</a> , have demonstrated that broad classes of such hidden-variable theories are in fact incompatible with quantum physics. According to Bell's theorem, if nature actually operates in accord with any theory of local hidden variables, then the results of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test_experiments">Bell test</a> will be constrained in a particular, quantifiable way. Many Bell tests have been performed, using entangled particles, and they have shown results incompatible with the constraints imposed by local hidden variables. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-wiseman15-14 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-wolchover17-15"><sup>[13][14]</sup></a></p>

    <p>It is not possible to present these concepts in more than a superficial way without introducing the actual mathematics involved; understanding quantum mechanics requires not only manipulating complex numbers, but also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory">linear algebra, differential equations, group theory</a>, and other more advanced subjects. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-18"><sup>[note 2]</sup></a> Accordingly, this article will present a mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics and survey its application to some useful and oft-studied examples.</p>

    <h2>Mathematical formulation</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><i>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics">Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics</a></i></p>

    <p>In the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum mechanical system is a vector 
        �\psi  belonging to a (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space">separable</a>) complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space </a>
        �
        {\mathcal {H}}. This vector is postulated to be normalized under the Hilbert space inner product, that is, it obeys 
        ⟨
        �
        ,
        �
        ⟩
        =
        1
        {\displaystyle \langle \psi ,\psi \rangle =1}, and it is well-defined up to a complex number of modulus 1 (the global phase), that is, 
        �\psi  and 
        �
        �
        �
        �{\displaystyle e^{i\alpha }\psi } represent the same physical system. In other words, the possible states are points in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space">projective space</a> of a Hilbert space, usually called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_space">complex projective space</a>. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system – for example, for describing position and momentum the Hilbert space is the space of complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-integrable">square-integrable</a> functions 
        �
        2
        (
        �
        )
        {\displaystyle L^{2}(\mathbb {C} )}, while the Hilbert space for the spin of a single proton is simply the space of two-dimensional complex vectors 
        �
        2
        {\mathbb  C}^{2} with the usual inner product.
        
        Physical quantities of interest – position, momentum, energy, spin – are represented by observables, which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_adjoint#Hermitian_operators">Hermitian</a> (more precisely, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adjoint_operator">self-adjoint</a>) linear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics)">operators</a> acting on the Hilbert space. A quantum state can be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector">eigenvector</a> of an observable, in which case it is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenstate">eigenstate</a>, and the associated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue">eigenvalue</a> corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. More generally, a quantum state will be a linear combination of the eigenstates, known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">quantum superposition</a> . When an observable is measured, the result will be one of its eigenvalues with probability given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule">Born rule</a> : in the simplest case the eigenvalue 
        �\lambda  is non-degenerate and the probability is given by 
        |
        ⟨
        �
        →
        ,
        �
        ⟩
        |
        2
        {\displaystyle |\langle {\vec {\lambda }},\psi \rangle |^{2}}, where 
        �
        →{\displaystyle {\vec {\lambda }}} is its associated eigenvector. More generally, the eigenvalue is degenerate and the probability is given by 
        ⟨
        �
        ,
        �
        �
        �
        ⟩{\displaystyle \langle \psi ,P_{\lambda }\psi \rangle }, where 
        �
        �P_{\lambda } is the projector onto its associated eigenspace. In the continuous case, these formulas give instead the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density">probability density</a> .
        
        </p>

        <p>After the measurement, if result 
            �\lambda  was obtained, the quantum state is postulated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_wavefunction">collapse</a> to 
            �
            →{\displaystyle {\vec {\lambda }}}, in the non-degenerate case, or to 
            �
            �
            �
            /
            ⟨
            �
            ,
            �
            �
            �
            ⟩{\displaystyle P_{\lambda }\psi /{\sqrt {\langle \psi ,P_{\lambda }\psi \rangle }}}, in the general case. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability">probabilistic</a> nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr%E2%80%93Einstein_debates">Bohr–Einstein debates</a>, in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment">thought experiments</a> . In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a "measurement" has been extensively studied. Newer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics">interpretations of quantum mechanics</a> have been formulated that do away with the concept of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_wavefunction">wave function collapse</a>" (see, for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">many-worlds interpretation</a>). The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wave functions become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Entanglement">entangled</a> so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity. For details, see the article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-google215-19">measurement in quantum mechanics. <sup>[17]</sup></a>

            <p>Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are independent of time, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenstate#Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">eigenstates</a> of the Hamiltonian. Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such "static" wave functions. For example, a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron">electron</a> in an unexcited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom">atom</a> is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus">atomic nucleus</a> , whereas in quantum mechanics, it is described by a static wave function surrounding the nucleus. For example, the electron wave function for an unexcited hydrogen atom is a spherically symmetric function known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atomic-orbital-clouds_spd_m0.png">s orbital (Fig. 1)</a>.

                Analytic solutions of the Schrödinger equation are known for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantum-mechanical_systems_with_analytical_solutions">very few relatively simple model Hamiltonians</a> including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator">quantum harmonic oscillator</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_box">particle in a box</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_cation">dihydrogen cation</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom">hydrogen atom</a>. Even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium">helium</a> atom – which contains just two electrons – has defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment.
                
                However, there are techniques for finding approximate solutions. One method, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)">perturbation theory</a>, uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to create a result for a related but more complicated model by (for example) the addition of a weak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy">potential energy</a> . Another method is called "semi-classical equation of motion", which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only small deviations from classical behavior. These deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion. This approach is particularly important in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chaos">quantum chaos</a> .

                One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">uncertainty principle</a> .

The fact that dependence in momentum is the Fourier transform of the dependence in position means that the momentum operator is equivalent (up to an

                    If the state for a composite system is entangled, it is impossible to describe either component system A or system B by a state vector. One can instead define <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_density_matrix">reduced density matrices</a> that describe the statistics that can be obtained by making measurements on either component system alone. This necessarily causes a loss of information, though: knowing the reduced density matrices of the individual systems is not enough to reconstruct the state of the composite system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-:0-24 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-wilde-26"><sup>[22][23]</sup></a> Just as density matrices specify the state of a subsystem of a larger system, analogously, positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) describe the effect on a subsystem of a measurement performed on a larger system. POVMs are extensively used in quantum information theory.[22][24]
                    
                    As described above, entanglement is a key feature of models of measurement processes in which an apparatus becomes entangled with the system being measured. Systems interacting with the environment in which they reside generally become entangled with that environment, a phenomenon known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence">quantum decoherence</a> . This can explain why, in practice, quantum effects are difficult to observe in systems larger than microscopic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-27"><sup>[25]</sup></a> </p>

            a smaller the spread in position gets smaller, but the spread in momentum gets larger. Conversely, by making

            a larger we make the spread in momentum smaller, but the spread in position gets larger. This illustrates the uncertainty principle.
            
            As we let the Gaussian wave packet evolve in time, we see that its center moves through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more and more uncertain. The uncertainty in momentum, however, stays constant. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-30"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

        A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_potential_well">finite potential well</a> is the generalization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells having finite depth. The finite potential well problem is mathematically more complicated than the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at the walls of the well. Instead, the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions outside the well. Another related problem is that of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangular_potential_barrier">rectangular potential barrier</a>, which furnishes a model for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunneling">quantum tunneling</a> effect that plays an important role in the performance of modern technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">flash memory</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope">scanning tunneling microscopy</a>.</p>

                One can therefore use the Mach–Zehnder interferometer to estimate the phase shift by estimating these probabilities.
                
                It is interesting to consider what would happen if the photon were definitely in either the "lower" or "upper" paths between the beam splitters. This can be accomplished by blocking one of the paths, or equivalently by removing the first beam splitter (and feeding the photon from the left or the bottom, as desired). In both cases, there will be no interference between the paths anymore, and the probabilities are given by

                Φ{\displaystyle \Delta \Phi }. From this we can conclude that the photon does not take one path or another after the first beam splitter, but rather that it is in a genuine quantum superposition of the two paths. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-vedral-33"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
